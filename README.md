# Arduino with LCD Display(I2C Module)

Here i have list down simple steps for connect ***Arduino with LCD Display***

> I have used two basic library

- [Wire](https://www.arduino.cc/en/reference/wire)(This is default one)
- [LiquidCrystal_I2C](https://github.com/karthick965938/Arduino_LCD_I2C/tree/master/Arduino-LiquidCrystal-I2C-library/) (click this link to download)

Run the I2C_address_finder.ino file after connecting I2C to arduino to get the address of I2C on the Serial Monitor because if the address is correct then connection cannot be established properly.
Generally the address remains same(i.e. 0x27) but it totally depends upon the manufacture/batch. 

Once you have install above libraries. First you can check simple code which is i have added below :) (copy and paste on your Arduino Compiler). If you have ran compiler successfully you can upload your code on Arduino Board.
```
#include <Wire.h> 
#include <LiquidCrystal_I2C.h>
//I2C pins declaration
LiquidCrystal_I2C lcd(0x27, 16, 2);
void setup() 
{
  lcd.begin();//Initializing display
  lcd.backlight();//To Power ON the back light
  //lcd.backlight();// To Power OFF the back light
}
void loop() 
{
  lcd.clear();// Clear your screen
  lcd.setCursor(0,0); //Defining positon to write from first row,first column .
  lcd.print("Spritle Tech"); //You can write 16 Characters per line .
  delay(1000);//Delay used to give a dynamic effect
  lcd.setCursor(3,1);  //Defining positon to write from second row,first column .
  lcd.print("Karthick Nagarajan");
}
```

***This is Actul circuit connection. I hope this will help on how to wiring.***
